TODO:

- Add day of the week version



CHANGELOG:

2019-10-15 #2

After further work, I have managed to get a stable and working class with functions.
There is now a main 'isdueToday' function that calls the resetDueDates function as part of its process. This means that, when using the class, set the initial date wisely, and then you will rely on the 'isDueToday' function to tell due dates. This should be called first.


2019-10-15 #1

In the normal version I made a function to reset the due date. This works, but I think there are some holes in it, for example - what happens if you miss a due date by a long time?

I started a new version that stores the due dates in a list. I now need to make it add dates to the list as they pass.

2019-10-10

I set up all the classes so each type of task knows when the task is meant to begin, and then it can tell you if it is due today.
I have also set up the day-name-based tasks too, which seems to work.
