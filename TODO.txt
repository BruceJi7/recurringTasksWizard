TODO:


- Make the tasks generate another due date when current due date is today.
	- Do I need another date variable for this?




CHANGELOG:

2019-10-10

I set up all the classes so each type of task knows when the task is meant to begin, and then it can tell you if it is due today.
I have also set up the day-name-based tasks too, which seems to work.
