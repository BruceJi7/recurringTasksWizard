TODO:

- Add due date reset function for list ver.



CHANGELOG:

2019-10-15

In the normal version I made a function to reset the due date. This works, but I think there are some holes in it, for example - what happens if you miss a due date by a long time?

I started a new version that stores the due dates in a list. I now need to make it add dates to the list as they pass.

I set up all the classes so each type of task knows when the task is meant to begin, and then it can tell you if it is due today.
I have also set up the day-name-based tasks too, which seems to work.
