# recurringTasksWizard

This program allows you to enter tasks that re-occur regularly - daily-based or monthly-based  - and it will display what tasks you have to do on the day they are due. You can also see what is due tomorrow, and see the tasks listed based on what's due soonest.

If you install this repo, don't forget to set the program to open on startup! Then it can be used as a reminder of what's due today.
